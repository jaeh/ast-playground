@magic makes it possible to create stunningly fast
webpages with minimal cognitive overhead.privacy@magic does not spy.not only do we try to be legally compliant by default,

usually, all the javascript in your homepage will be 30-60kb big (after unpacking),
10-30kb get transmitted from the server to the client.
this documentation page you are reading loads less than 20kb of gzipped javascript,
which, when parsing, turns into ~55kb of uncompressed javascript.
this includes all content of all subpages, no additional server requests needed for all navigations.@magic works without javascriptmost of the functionality works without javascript,
