the index pages for yearly and monthly archives are not polished,
but can be overwritten by adding them to the config.BLOG_DIR dir of your @magic app.to use the blog,
create an archive dir, for example
copysrc/blog/2019/12/22/then just add the blogposts in that directory structure.@magic will automagically build a blog directory for you,
including the archives for yearly, monthly and overall blog posts.more information following soon.Blog Archives:year: 2019month: 12 2019made with a few bits of magic
